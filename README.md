# Gocanteen API

This is the backend repository for Gocanteen App. The frontend repository can be accessed [here](https://github.com/go-canteen/go-canteen-next.git)

---

This is a [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) template for deploying an app on https://fly.io

Some features of this template:

1. No session authentication - it assumes you use fly.io, which gives you access to run commands directly via `manage.py`
2. HTTP health checks - using fly.io's [http checks](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/#services-http_checks), you can have fly connect to this app and issue a basic request against `/ping/` to check DB connectivity
3. Local dev via `docker compose` and a `Dockerfile` to run the app
4. OpenAPI and Swagger ready via `drf-yasg` package
5. Ready to go: clone and run on fly via `fly launch`, then run a migration and get a dev token via:
  * `fly ssh console -C 'bash /app/provision_db.sh'`
  * `fly ssh console -C 'python /app/manage.py migrate`
  * `fly ssh console -C 'python /app/manage.py getdevtoken'`
